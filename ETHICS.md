# Ethical Considerations for Mental Health AI

## 1. Data Privacy
- **No Persistent Storage**: User data (journals, audio) is processed in-memory and discarded after analysis.
- **Local Execution**: The system is designed to run locally, ensuring data doesn't leave the user's control.

## 2. Limits of AI Diagnosis
- **Not a Medical Tool**: This tool generates a "Risk Score" for informational purposes only. It is **not** a clinical diagnosis.
- **False Positives/Negatives**: AI models can misinterpret nuance. Users are always advised to seek professional help.

## 3. Transparency
- **Explainability**: The system aims to provide "Actionable Insights" to explain why a score was given (e.g., "High usage of negative sentiment words").
- **Score Interpretation**: Scores are color-coded to avoid alarmism, focusing on "wellness" vs "risk".
